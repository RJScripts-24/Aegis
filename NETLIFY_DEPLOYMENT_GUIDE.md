   ### Landing Page Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api
   VITE_MAP_PUBLIC_URL = https://aegis-map.netlify.app
   VITE_INCIDENT_ADMIN_URL = https://aegis-incident-admin.netlify.app
   VITE_MISSION_ADMIN_URL = https://aegis-mission-admin.netlify.app
   VITE_REPORT_INCIDENTS_URL = https://aegis-report.netlify.app
   VITE_LANDING_PAGE_URL = https://aegis-landing.netlify.app
   ```

   ### Map Public Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api
   VITE_REPORT_INCIDENTS_URL = https://aegis-report.netlify.app
   VITE_LANDING_PAGE_URL = https://aegis-landing.netlify.app
   ```

   ### Location Popup Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api
   VITE_MAP_PUBLIC_URL = https://aegis-map.netlify.app
   ```

   ### Report Incidents Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api

   VITE_LANDING_PAGE_URL = https://aegis-landing.netlify.app
   ```

   ### Mission Admin Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api
   VITE_INCIDENT_ADMIN_URL = https://aegis-incident-admin.netlify.app
   VITE_LANDING_PAGE_URL = https://aegis-landing.netlify.app
   ```

   ### Incident Admin Environment Variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL = https://your-backend-url.com/api
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete (1-3 minutes)
   - You'll get a URL like `https://aegis-landing.netlify.app`

6. **Repeat for all 6 apps**

## üîÑ After First Deployment

Once you have all Netlify URLs, **update the environment variables** to use the actual Netlify URLs instead of placeholder ones.

Go to each site:
- Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
- Update URLs with actual deployed URLs
- Click "Clear cache and deploy site" to rebuild

## üìù Important Notes

### Backend CORS Configuration
Update your backend to allow your Netlify domains:

```javascript
// backend/src/config/index.js
corsOrigin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || 
  'https://aegis-landing.netlify.app,https://aegis-map.netlify.app,https://aegis-report.netlify.app,https://aegis-incident-admin.netlify.app,https://aegis-mission-admin.netlify.app,https://aegis-location.netlify.app'
```

### Auto-Deploy
Netlify automatically redeploys when you push to your main branch on GitHub.

### Custom Domains (Optional)
You can add custom domains in Netlify:
- Site settings ‚Üí Domain management ‚Üí Add custom domain
- Examples:
  - `aegis.yourdomain.com` ‚Üí Landing Page
  - `map.aegis.yourdomain.com` ‚Üí Map Public
  - etc.

### Build Configuration
All settings are in `netlify.toml` files (already configured ‚úÖ)

## üéØ Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy Landing Page
- [ ] Deploy Map Public
- [ ] Deploy Location Popup
- [ ] Deploy Report Incidents
- [ ] Deploy Mission Admin
- [ ] Deploy Incident Admin
- [ ] Update all environment variables with actual Netlify URLs
- [ ] Update backend CORS configuration
- [ ] Test navigation between apps
- [ ] Test API calls to backend
- [ ] Verify all features work

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check build logs in Netlify deploy log
- Verify `npm run build` works locally
- Check if all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify base directory is correct

### Navigation Not Working
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check that URLs don't have trailing slashes
- Ensure all apps are deployed and accessible
- Check browser console for errors

### API Calls Failing
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` points to your deployed backend
- Check backend CORS configuration
- Verify backend is accessible from Netlify
- Check Network tab in browser DevTools

### "Page Not Found" on Refresh
- Already handled by `netlify.toml` redirects (‚úÖ)
- If still occurring, check the `[[redirects]]` section in netlify.toml

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Branch Deploys**: Each branch gets its own preview URL
2. **Deploy Previews**: Every PR gets an automatic preview
3. **Rollback**: Easy one-click rollback to previous deploys
4. **Analytics**: Enable Netlify Analytics for traffic insights
5. **Forms**: Use Netlify Forms for contact forms (no backend needed)

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- All 6 apps are deployed and accessible
- You can navigate between apps using buttons/links
- API calls to backend work
- No console errors in browser
- All features function as expected
