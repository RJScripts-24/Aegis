## ðŸš€ Next Steps - You Need To Do These

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues: video path, build output, and dynamic URLs"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy Each App on Netlify

Deploy these 5 apps as **separate sites** on Netlify:

- [ ] **Landing Page** 
  - Base: `frontend/Landing Page`
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Publish: `dist`
  
- [ ] **IncidentAdmin**
  - Base: `frontend/IncidentAdmin`
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Publish: `dist`
  
- [ ] **MapPublic**
  - Base: `frontend/mapPublic`
  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Publish: `dist`
  
- [ ] **MissionAdmin**

  - Publish: `dist`
  
- [ ] **ReportIncidents**

  - Build: `npm run build`
  - Publish: `dist`

### 3. Configure Landing Page Environment Variables

After all deployments, get the URLs and add to Landing Page on Netlify:

Go to: Landing Page Site â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables

Add these (replace with your actual URLs):

```
VITE_MAP_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-map-public.netlify.app
VITE_INCIDENT_ADMIN_URL=https://your-incident-admin.netlify.app
VITE_MISSION_ADMIN_URL=https://your-mission-admin.netlify.app
VITE_REPORT_INCIDENTS_URL=https://your-report-incidents.netlify.app
```

### 4. Redeploy Landing Page

After adding environment variables:
- [ ] Go to Deploys tab
- [ ] Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"

### 5. Test Everything

- [ ] Landing Page loads correctly
- [ ] Video displays in hero section
- [ ] "Get Alerts" button opens Map Public app
- [ ] "Admin Login" button opens Incident Admin app
- [ ] No localhost URLs in production
