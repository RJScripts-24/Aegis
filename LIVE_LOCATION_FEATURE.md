# Live Location Feature Documentation

## Overview
The mapPublic application now includes a comprehensive live location tracking feature that allows users to access and display their real-time location on the map. This feature automatically updates as the user moves and provides visual feedback about location accuracy.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Location Detection**
- The app automatically requests the user's location when it loads
- Uses the browser's native Geolocation API for high accuracy
- Implements proper error handling for denied permissions or unavailable location services

### 2. **Live Location Tracking**
- Continuously monitors the user's position using `watchPosition`
- Updates the map center and user marker in real-time as the user moves
- Provides high-accuracy positioning with GPS when available

### 3. **Visual Indicators**

#### Location Button States
The locate button (top-right corner) changes color based on location status:
- **White** - Location not yet acquired
- **Blue** (spinning) - Currently acquiring location
- **Green** - Location active and tracking

#### Location Status Badge
When location is active, a badge appears showing:
- Green pulsing dot indicator
- "Live" status
- Accuracy radius (e.g., "±15m")

#### Map Marker
- Blue pulsing marker shows user's current location
- "Your Location" label with live update indicator
- Dynamically updates position as user moves

### 4. **User Interactions**

#### Click Locate Button
- First click: Requests location permission and starts tracking
- Subsequent clicks: Re-centers map on current location
- If error occurred: Retries location request

### 5. **Error Handling**
Comprehensive error handling for common scenarios:
- **Permission Denied**: Notifies user to enable location permissions
- **Position Unavailable**: Alerts when GPS/location service is unavailable
- **Timeout**: Handles cases where location request takes too long
- **Browser Compatibility**: Detects if geolocation is not supported

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState<[number, number] | null>(null);
const [isLoadingLocation, setIsLoadingLocation] = useState(false);
const [locationError, setLocationError] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [locationAccuracy, setLocationAccuracy] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [watchId, setWatchId] = useState<number | null>(null);
```

### Key Functions

#### `getUserLocation()`
- Requests one-time location from browser
- Sets initial position and accuracy
- Starts continuous watching
- Displays toast notifications

#### `startWatchingLocation()`
- Monitors position changes continuously
- Updates location state in real-time
- Provides high accuracy mode
- Cleans up previous watch if exists

#### `handleLocateMe()`
- User-triggered location action
- Re-centers map on current location
- Handles retry on errors
- Shows appropriate feedback

### Geolocation Options
```typescript
{
  enableHighAccuracy: true,  // Use GPS for better accuracy
  timeout: 10000,            // 10 second timeout
  maximumAge: 0              // Don't use cached position
}
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **App Load**
   - App automatically requests location permission
   - User sees permission prompt from browser
   - Once granted, location is acquired and displayed

2. **Location Active**
   - Green locate button indicates active tracking
   - Badge shows "Live" status and accuracy
   - Blue marker on map shows current position
   - Map centers on user's location

3. **User Movement**
   - As user moves, marker updates automatically
   - Map can be manually re-centered using locate button
   - Accuracy information updates in real-time

4. **Error Recovery**
   - If permission denied, user can click locate button to retry
   - Error messages guide user on how to fix issues
   - Graceful fallback to default location if tracking unavailable

## Browser Permissions

### Required Permission
- **Geolocation**: Access to device location services

### Permission Prompt
When the app loads or user clicks locate button, browser shows:
> "[Site] wants to know your location"
> - Block / Allow

Users must click "Allow" for the feature to work.

### Troubleshooting Permission Issues

#### Chrome/Edge
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Select "Site settings"
3. Change Location to "Allow"
4. Refresh page

#### Firefox
1. Click lock icon in address bar
2. Click ">" next to "Blocked" or "Permissions"
3. Enable Location access
4. Refresh page

#### Safari
1. Go to Safari > Preferences > Websites > Location Services
2. Find your site and set to "Allow"
3. Refresh page

## Privacy & Security

### Data Usage
- Location data is **only used locally** in the browser
- No location data is sent to servers (unless explicitly implemented)
- User has full control via browser permissions

### Best Practices
- Always request permission with clear purpose
- Respect user's choice to deny permission
- Provide fallback functionality if location unavailable
- Stop watching location when not needed (cleanup)

## Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers
- ✅ Chrome 5+
- ✅ Firefox 3.5+
- ✅ Safari 5+
- ✅ Edge (all versions)
- ✅ Opera 10.6+
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Detection
The app automatically detects if geolocation is unavailable:
```typescript
if (!navigator.geolocation) {
  // Show error message
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Battery Impact
- `watchPosition` with `enableHighAccuracy` can drain battery
- Consider implementing sleep/wake based on user activity
- Option to manually stop tracking when not needed

### Network Usage
- Map tiles load as needed
- Location updates are client-side only
- Minimal data usage for location tracking itself

### Optimization Tips
1. Use `maximumAge` to cache position for short periods
2. Increase `timeout` value for slower devices
3. Implement geofencing to reduce update frequency
4. Stop watching when app in background

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
- [ ] Location history/trail visualization
- [ ] Geofencing alerts for emergency zones
- [ ] Share location with emergency contacts
- [ ] Offline location caching
- [ ] Custom accuracy threshold settings
- [ ] Battery-saving mode option
- [ ] Location-based notifications
- [ ] Distance/speed calculations

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **First Load**: Permission prompt appears, location acquired
2. **Permission Denied**: Error message shows, retry option available
3. **Location Unavailable**: Appropriate error handling
4. **User Movement**: Marker updates smoothly
5. **Re-center**: Clicking locate button centers map
6. **Multiple Tabs**: Each tab tracks independently
7. **Browser Refresh**: Permission persists across sessions

### Manual Testing
1. Open app in browser
2. Allow location permission
3. Verify green button and live badge appear
4. Move device and confirm marker updates
5. Click locate button to test re-centering
6. Block permission and verify error handling
